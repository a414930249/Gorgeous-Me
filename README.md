## Welcome to My Blog Pages

### Introduction Of Myself 
My name is Zhu Wanyu   


##### who am i 

I am interested in many technologies(internet) that i don't know, especially today's AI.   
I also like to dig into the area that i already know.   
you could call me tec-freak, ha ha!.   


##### what i have done
Now i work as a java and big-data developer and also a java-architect-assistant.  
In my job, I have designed an system with high availability, extensibility for my company.  
I also managed to solve problems and develop better system in products iteration.   
Transforming monolithic application into distribute, micro-services architecture and Database structure designing dominates my time. 


##### what i want to do
Since 2015, i have learned machine learning, i was deeply involved by the magic, and i believe it(nowadays AI) will be the next revolution. 
practical application of AI is really wide. google self-driving car just like a witchcraft which really appeals to me.  
it relates to computer-vision, deep learning.   
Although this new field(Deep learning, CV and so on) seems to have nothing to do with my current job, i plan to try it at my partially time in the next few years.  
Of course, i won't neglect what i have.
